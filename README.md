Hey This is the README.
This is the Web Interface For My Custom AI Model.
The AI model is named model.py
# Model_WebView
Custom AI Model With Web Interface For EMNIST [Mini-Batching]
I have a selection of around 5 models
Some Are Mnist and others are EMnIst trained.
all are made using different settigs of the cusotm python file included and another one with less features.
Currently only python is available due to my Lazy Ass not being able to save the other language models.
shoot me an email at saadaamir034@gmail.com if you want any features added or you could dm me on discord saad_aamir
