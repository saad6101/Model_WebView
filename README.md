Custom AI Model With Web Interface For EMNIST [Mini-Batching]
I have a selection of around 5 models
Some Are Mnist and others are EMnIst trained.
all are made using different settigs of the cusotm python file included and another one with less features.
Currently only python is available due to my Lazy Ass not being able to save the other language models.
shoot me an email at saadaamir034@gmail.com if you want any features added or you could dm me on discord saad_aamir
If you want any models added give me the loader script and the weights file.
You can use my model file inside the models folder to train a new model for yourself to use.
Get your CSV set it in the loader. Configure your output and input neurons. Configure the amount of neurons in the 2 hidden layers by changing dfh and gfh. 
After that just set a learning rate and batch size or use the default.
then just run the script and that's your new model. yaay
This is a demonstration project.
